            <h2>Ninety-Seven Things Every Programmer Should Know</h2>
            <h3>Edited by Kevlin Henney</h3><br><br>
            <h4>General reflection:</h4><br>
            <p>This is a cool book with lots of different pieces of advice. Though a few of them go pretty deep into
                granular details and procedures that are somewhat beyond me, many of the ninety-seven things do have real substance 
                that I know, even at this early level of my career, I will benefit from.</p><br>
            <p>It's also interesting to see how these coders write. Writing code is one thing, but writing in English is another.
                It was neat to be able to observe in this book how one can have an influence on the other.</p><br>
            <h4>Key takeaways from the book:</h4>
            <ol class="headings">
                <li><a href="#1">Simple is beautiful</a></li>
                <li><a href="#2">Follow the single responsibility principle</a></li>
                <li><a href="#3">Never stop learning</a></li>
                <li><a href="#4">Work well with others</a></li>
                <li><a href="#5">Write code to be understood by others</a></li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h5 id="1">1) Simple is beautiful</h5><br>
            <p>This idea comes up over and over in this book. Keeping code as simple as possible not only makes it easier
                to understand, it also makes it work better. And, for those of us who have an appreciation for this sort of thing,
                it can also make your code more beautiful.
            </p><br>
            <p class="quote">"There is one quote from Plato that I think is particularly good for all software developers 
                to know and keep close to their hearts: 'Beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depends on 
                simplicity.'"<br><br>
                "Improve code by removing it."</p><br>
            <p class="right-align"><a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a></p><br>

            <h5 id="2">2) Follow the single responsibility principle</h5><br>
            <p>The single responsibility principle is related to keeping things simple, but it's a very specific application of simplicity.
                I've also heard it described as reducing dependancies. If you need to change something in your code, it shouldn't lead to you
                needing to make all other kinds of changes in different spots as a result.
            </p><br>
            <p class="quote">"Gather together those things that change for the same reason, and separate those things that change for 
                different reasons."<br><br>
                "No matter how complex the total application or system is, the individual parts have to be kept simple:
                simple objects with a single responsibility containing similarly simple, focussed methods with descriptive names."</p><br>
            <p class="right-align"><a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a></p><br>
                
            <h5 id="3">3) Never stop learning</h5><br>
            <p>Learning to code really is a never-ending process. That's part of what makes it great. It also means that you have to keep
                pushing yourself.
            </p><br>
            <p class="quote">"You need to keep learning to stay marketable... [and] you need to take responsibility for your own 
                education."<br><br>
                "If you explore new languages to expand your mind and get fresh ideas on how you can solve things in different ways,
                you will find that the code you write in your trusty old language gets more beautiful for every new language you've 
                learned."</p><br>
            <p class="right-align"><a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a></p><br>

            <h5 id="4">4) Work well with others</h5><br>
            <p>I don't mind working on my own, and sometimes I even prefer it. But working with others gives you more opportunities to learn
                from each other, and it can make the work more fun. However, this is true only if you know how to work with others well.
                That means you know how to participate and contribute meaningfully, and, even more importantly, that you know how to
                listen.<br><br>
                A few writers in the book also discuss 'pair programming' where you work together in pairs and regularly change them up.
                I'm not sure if this is still a current practice, but it seems like a very cool idea.
            </p><br>
            <p class="quote">"Beyond communication with machines, programmers need to communicate with their peers. Today's large projects
                are more social endeavours than simply the applied art of programming."<br><br>
                "The 'lone wolf' approach to programming has been giving way to a more collaborative approach, which, I would argue,
                improves quality, productivity, and job satisfaction for programmers."</p><br>
            <p class="right-align"><a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a></p><br>

            <h5 id="5">5) Write code to be understood by others</h5><br>
            <p>In this case, 'others' refers both to your co-workers and to your users. Your co-workers need to be able to understand
                your work at the code level. Users need to be able to understand your work at the user (or user-interface) level.
            </p><br>
            <p class="quote">"Think of every line of code you write as a message for someone in the future ... [who] would see your code
                and say, 'Wow! This is great! I can understand perfectly what's been done here.'"<br><br>
                "The best way to find out how a user thinks is to watch one.... Spending one hour watching users is more informative
                than spending a day guessing what they want."</p><br>
