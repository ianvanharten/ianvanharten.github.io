            <h3>By Don Norman</h3><br><br>
            <h4>General reflection:</h4><br>
            <p>The Design of Everyday Things is one of those rare books that instantly makes you see the world differently. 
                After reading this book, my fundamental perceptions &mdash; even for something as simple as a door &mdash; 
                have been forever changed and enhanced.</p><br>
            <p>Being more aware of design and its role in how everything gets made has added new layers of depth, 
                complexity, and connectivity to how I think about just about everything.</p><br>
            <h4>Key takeaways from the book:</h4><br>

            <br>

            <h5 id="1">1) The concepts of design apply everywhere</h5><br>
            <p>I picked up this book in order to learn about design in the context of web development and computer programming, 
                but these concepts can be applied to anything that humans make. Having a better awareness of design can allow you 
                to see into the deeper layers of apparently simple objects.</p>
            <p class="quote">“All artificial things are designed. Whether it is the layout of furniture in a room, the paths through 
                a garden or forest, or the intricacies of an electronic device, some person or group of people had to decide upon the 
                layout, operations, and mechanisms.”<br><br>
                “Not all designed things involve physical structures. Services, lectures, rules and procedures, and 
                the organizational structures of businesses and governments do not have physical mechanisms, but their rules of 
                operation have to be designed.”</p><br>

            <h5 id="2">2) Good design = technological functionality + human usability</h5><br>
            <p>It’s one thing to make something that works; it's another to make something that's also easy to use. 
                Design thinking involves the technical knowledge of how things function combined with the more experiential knowledge of 
                how humans function.</p>
            <p class="quote">“Design presents a fascinating interplay of technology and psychology, [and] designers must understand both.” 
                <br><br>“Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions 
                are possible, what is happening, and what is about to happen.”
                </p><br>

            <h5 id ="3">3) Don’t blame the user. Blame the design</h5><br>
            <p>When something fails, the onus is on the design, not the user. This was a big shift in our thinking about design, and it is largely 
                thanks to Don Norman. When you do come across something that is poorly designed, though, don’t stop at blaming 
                the design. Think about how you could make it better.</p>
            <p class="quote">“We design equipment that requires people to be fully alert and attentive for hours, or to remember archaic, 
                confusing procedures even if they are only used infrequently, sometimes only once in a lifetime… Then we wonder why there 
                is failure.”<br><br>
                “Don’t criticize unless you can do better.”</p><br>

            <h5 id="4">4) The secret to success is to understand what the real problem is</h5><br>
            <p>In the book, Don Norman describes an exercise he does with his university class where he gives the students a problem
                and asks them to solve it. After they present their detailed analysis of the solution, he asks them, "How do you know
                you solved the correct problem?"<br><br> 
                You have to make sure that you are in fact addressing the root of the issue, or else 
                all the time you spend on a solution might only deal with a symptom, and not the real problem.
            </p>
            <p class="quote">“In the real world, the problems do not come in nice, neat packages. They have to be discovered. It is all 
                too easy to see only the surface problems and never dig deeper to address the real issues.”<br><br>
                “Requirements made in the abstract are invariably wrong. Requirements produced by 
                asking people what they need are invariably wrong. Requirements are developed by watching people in their natural 
                environment.”</p><br>

            <h5 id="5">5) Question the obvious</h5><br>
            <p>Asking the right questions is essential to unlocking what the real problem is and how to approach it. No question should
                be out of bounds.</p>
            <p class="quote">“I am particularly fond of ‘stupid’ questions. A stupid question asks about things so fundamental that 
                everyone assumes the answer is obvious. But when the question is taken seriously, it often turns out to be profound: 
                the obvious often is not obvious at all. What we assume to be obvious is simply the way things have always been done, 
                but now that it is questioned, we don’t actually know the reasons.”</p><br>

            <h5 id="6">6) Failure = experience</h5><br>
            <p>I had a professor in my first year who gave us assignments knowing we were not fully prepared and that we would struggle.
                A lot of us were upset at first (including me). He told us afterwards that struggle was good because if you struggle with
                something on your own then chances are you are going to remember it better and learn more from it.<br><br>
                You learn more from struggle and failure than you do from success.</p>
            <p class="quote">“Failures are to be encouraged—actually, they shouldn’t be called failures: they should be thought of 
                as learning experiences. If everything works perfectly, little is learned. Learning occurs when there are difficulties.”</p><br>

            <h5 id="7">7) On Conversation</h5><br>
            <p>I enjoyed this section on understanding errors that used conversation as an illustration. The type of conversation he describes 
                here is a good reminder of how healthy and enjoyable conversations can take place.</p>
            <p class="quote">“Consider a conversation between two people. Are errors made? Yes, but they are not treated as such. If a 
                person says something that is not understandable, we ask for clarification. If a person says something that we believe 
                to be false, we question and debate… We ask for more information and engage in mutual dialogue to reach an understanding. 
                In normal conversations between two friends, misstatements are taken as normal, as approximations to what was really meant. 
                Grammatical errors, self-corrections, and restarted phrases are ignored. In fact, they are usually not even detected because 
                we concentrate upon the intended meaning, not the surface features.”</p><br>

            <h5 id="8">8) The difference between hindsight and foresight</h5><br>
            <p>This section comes from a chapter in the book about investigating errors and understanding how they occur. I found this quote 
                interesting not only in its relation to design, but also for what it says about the way we investigate and understand current 
                or historical events.</p>
            <p class="quote">“Hindsight makes events seem obvious and predictable. Foresight is difficult. During an incident, there are 
                never clear clues. Many things are happening at once: workload is high, emotions and stress levels are high. Many things that 
                are happening will turn out to be irrelevant. Things that appear irrelevant will turn out to be critical. The accident 
                investigators, working with hindsight, knowing what really happened, will focus on the relevant information and ignore the 
                irrelevant. But at the time the events were happening, the operators did not have the information that allowed them to 
                distinguish one from the other.”</p><br>
