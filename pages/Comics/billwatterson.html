            <img src="../../images/InphoInterviewsBillWatterson/Inpho Interviews BW - 01.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of a newspaper comics page.) The purpose of comics, back when they were first added to
            newspapers, was to promote and help sell more of the newspaper.
            They consisted mostly of cheap gags and puns, but they were 
            decently popular, and they did the job they were meant for." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/InphoInterviewsBillWatterson/Inpho Interviews BW - 02.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of different merchandising products, like underwear and mugs.) Now, they don't 
            do much to help sell newspapers anymore, but comics have continued to serve this 
            function of essentially being hollow marketing vessels that help to sell other products ..."

            <img src="../../images/InphoInterviewsBillWatterson/Inpho Interviews BW - 03.jpg"

            sometimes with profits in the millions." class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of a tiger tail hanging from a tree, reminiscent of Calvin and Hobbes.) 
            But if you go past this commercial layer, 
            you will find that comics also have the 
            ability to express imaginative, authentic, 
            and meaningful ideas." class="panel">

            insisted on this very fact. He's the creator of Calvin and Hobbes

            alt="Inpho: So maybe we could start
            with how you got into comics.
            What was it about them
            that attracted you?
            BW: Well, I've wanted to 
            be a cartoonist pretty 
            much my whole life..." class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of Inpho's space ship flying through comic panels.) 
            BW: I saw early on that 'comics can
            be vehicles for beautiful artwork,
            and serious, intelligent expression." class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of the comics page in a newspaper cluttered with fear and distraction.)
            BW: Sadly, the commercial, mass market needs of newspapers
            are not sympathetic to the concerns of artistic expression." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/InphoInterviewsBillWatterson/Inpho Interviews BW - 11.jpg" 
            alt="Inpho: Why is that, exactly?
            BW: Well, in order for a comic
            to get published in a newspaper,
            the artist generally has to first hand 
            over the ownership of the characters, 
            copyright, and all the exploitation 
            rights..." class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of Inpho being threatened by a troll to give up his creative control.)
            BW: Without creator control over the work, the comics

            <img src="../../images/InphoInterviewsBillWatterson/Inpho Interviews BW - 13.jpg" 
            alt="BW: And since newspapers are 
            nearly all going out of business,
            most of the money to be made 
            in comics comes from selling cheap 
            merchandise. With the result that most
            comics are promoted based on their 
            potential for branding T-shirts and
            plush dolls, not for their ability 
            to engage and express ideas." class="panel">

            alt="Inpho: Wait.. but doesn't the ability to 
            merchandise just mean that a lot of people 
            like your stuff? Is selling products with your 
            logo on it really all that incompatible with
            expressing yourself authentically?
            BW: Well, maybe not in 
            the absolute sense. 
            However..." class="panel">

            taken seriously while 
            using the strip's protaganist to sell boxer shorts are deluding 
            themselves." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/InphoInterviewsBillWatterson/Inpho Interviews BW - 17.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of Inpho selling his soul.) BW: When your characters start 
            endorsing major companies, then
            '[your] job is no longer to be an original 
            thinker; [your] job is to keep your

            BW: I look at cartoons as an art, as a form of personal 
            expression. That's why I write and draw every line myself, 
            and why I refuse to dilute or corrupt the strip's message 
            with merchandising." class="panel">

            BW: Yes. And I'll say one more thing about that." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/InphoInterviewsBillWatterson/Inpho Interviews BW - 20.jpg" 
            alt="BW: To attract and keep an audience art must entertain, but the significance of any art
            lies in its ability to express truths--to reveal and help us understand our world." class="panel">

            alt="Inpho: Well Bill, you've certainly given us a lot to think about. Thanks for coming on the show.
            BW: It's been a pleasure, Inpho." class="panel">
