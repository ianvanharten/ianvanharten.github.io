            alt="(Cartoon of Albert Einstein.) Albert Einstein is a famous scientist for many reasons."

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 02.jpg" 
            alt="He proved the existence of atoms, he devised the theories of special and general relativity,
            he demonstrated the link between mass and energy, and a whole lot more." class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of Inpho at the microphone.) 
            But it isn't only for these achievements that we remember him. 
            We also remember Einstein for his creative process which led to his making those discoveries.
            The key to which, as Einstein himself describes, was imagination and visual thinking." 
            class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 04.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of Einstein's book.) In his book, Cosmic Religion and Other Opinions
            and Aphorisms, Einstein writes: Imagination is more important than knowledge.
            For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress,
            and giving birth to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research." 
            class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 05.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of Einstein in the classroom.)
            One thing that influenced Einstein toward this way of thinking was a school he attended in Aarau, 
            Switzerland. This school placed special emphasis on the visualization of ideas as the most effective
            way to understand them. The school was modeled on the ideas of the Swiss educational reformer, 
            Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, who wrote that 'visual understanding is the essential and only true means 
            of teaching how to judge things correctly.'" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 06.jpg" 
            alt="Here Einstein was trained how to conceptualize his ideas in a visual form.
            The most concrete example of how this manifested in his scientific work is what
            he called the thought experiment. A thought experiment is an experiment that takes
            place visually in your mind. Usually, it takes the form of the question, 
            'What would happen if ... ?'" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 07.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of Einstein riding a beam of light.)
            Einstein's own most famous thought experiment was to imagine what would happen
            if he could ride alongside a light beam. What would light look like from that perspective?
            What would the world look like from that point of view?" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 08.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of Einstein thinking.) This experiment, which he mulled over for many years, was what led
            him to many of his greatest discoveries. And he continued to use thought experiments as a thinking aid to
            help him visualize his ideas." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 09.jpg" 
            alt="Images and visual symbols are helpful because they can condense information into 
            a much simpler and more intuitive form. A well-crafted thought experiment can take an 
            abstract and complicated idea, and turn it into something concrete and much easier 
            to understand. " class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 10.jpg" 
            alt="When you think about it, the fact that our imaginations can be used as a tool to reveal 
            and reflect the actual nature of reality is pretty amazing! Especially considering the fact that it 
            can also be used to create entirely fake realities that also seem real." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 11.jpg" 
            alt="Indeed, our imagination can be as much a tool for personal wish-fulfillment as it can be 
            for scientific discovery. It can allow us to see what we want to see, as opposed to 
            what's really there. Imagination and reality are, in fact, more commonly at odds with each other 
            than they are in harmony. Einstein himself, when confronted with the discoveries of quantum 
            physics, found their implications to be deeply at odds with the reality to which he was accustomed
            (as do most people)." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 12.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of Neil DeGrasse Tyson.) But as the great Neil DeGrasse Tyson often says: 
            'The universe is under no obligation to make sense to us.' His reboot of the Cosmos series
            also begins with a simlar line..." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 13.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of Inpho's spaceship flying across a giant eyeball in outer space.)
            On this journey we'll need imagination. But imagination alone is not enough.
            For the reality of nature is greater than anything we can imagine." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Imagination and Reality/Imagination and Reality - 14.jpg" 
            alt="Einstein showed us the incredible power of the human imagination. But, in the end, 
            imagination is only a tool. And, when set next to reality as a whole, it is but a limited and
            imperfect one at best. The universe as we imagine it today can always be proven incorrect
            tomorrow, pending only the next great discovery. This is to say that:
            Big though the imagination may be, it is never so big that it can't be stretched further." class="panel">
