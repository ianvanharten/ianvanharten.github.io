            alt="(Cartoon of George Orwell and Horizon magazine.) In 1946, one year after the 
            end of WWII, Horizon Magazine in the UK published the most important piece of writing
            ever written. It was an essay called 'Politics and the English Language', written by 
            George Orwell." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 02.jpg" 
            alt="Now, granted, not a lot of people will agree with me on this. Most people would probably say that 
            there's a whole lot of other writing that's way more important than this measly essay. 
            (List of other perhaps more important works: 1. The Bible 2. Principia Mathematica 
            3. The Collected Works of Shakespeare 4. The U.S. Constitution 5. On the Origin of Species
            6. The Magna Carta 7. Harry Potter...)" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 03.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of Orwell's head alongside his books.) Even when limited to only Orwell's 
            own writing -- which includes works like Animal Farm and 1984 -- -- almost no one would pick 
            'Politics and the English Language' as his most important work." class="panel">

            talk about other people's stupid opinions! Only mine! This is my podcast, GOD-DAMMIT!"

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 05.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of a brain lit up and bright with electricity.) Anyway, in my opinion, when it comes to
            understanding how to cultivate a sharp and clear mind, how to think for yourself, and how to communicate 
            truth ... George Orwell's 'Politics and the English Language' is the most important thing you'll 
            ever read." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 06.jpg" 
            alt="(In the podcast studio with Inpho and George Orwell.) Inpho: And here in the studio
            to discuss it with me now: it's George Orwell! Thanks for coming on the podcast, George.

            in 1946. You write..." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 08.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of George Orwell next to his quote.) One ought to realize that the present 
            political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can bring 
            about some improvement by starting on the verbal end." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 09.jpg" 
            alt="Inpho: Could you elaborate on that a little bit?
            GO: Certainly! You see, the state of our politics is directly related to the quality of our language 
            and our ability to express ourselves..." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 10.jpg" 
            alt="GO: A free society relies on the ability of free thinking individuals to express their 
            thoughts with clarity and meaning. (Cartoon of Inpho saying, 'I think')" class="panel">

            alt="GO: But when our language gets muddled up with euphemisms, self-censorship, and vagueness,
            that creates the conditions for totalitarianism. (Image of Inpho saying, 'In my apocalyptically
            unambiguous opinion, it is not an unjustifiable assumption that...')" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 12.jpg" 
            alt="GO: To see the difference more closely, let's take a look at an example. This is a passage 
            from Ecclesiastes in the Bible, an example of good language:" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 13.jpg" 
            alt="(Text shows images of the sun, a runner, a muscular arm, bread, money, a clock, dice, and a skull.)
            I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle
            to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, for time 
            and chance happeneth to them all." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 14.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of Inpho recalling all the images from the text.) GO: You see how this
            passage uses simple words and concrete images that allow you to see the meaning as a series 
            of pictures?" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 15.jpg" 
            alt="GO: Now compare that to this version of the same passage translated into modern English: 
            (Image of a kooky, unshowered professor giving a lecture, saying 'Objective considerations of
            contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competetive activities
            exhibits no tendancy to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element
            of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.')" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 16.jpg" 
            alt="GO: You see how abstract and meaningless those words become? Rather than communicating what 
            you mean, this way of talking allows you to keep the meaning hidden--even from yourself!" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 17.jpg" 
            alt="(Back in the podcast studio.) Inpho: This is where the connection with politics fits in, I imagine.
            GO: That's right. You see..." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 18.jpg" 
            alt="GO: The more you succumb to this level of language, the more you turn into a kind of 
            machine, where the appropriate noises are coming out of your larynx, but your brain is not involved.
            (Cartoon of Inpho brainwashed saying, 'It is problematic that the post-colonial, transglobalized extrapolation 
            of complex metaprocesses are not unracistly deniable.')" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 19.jpg" 
            alt="GO: And this reduced state of consciousness, if not indispensible, is at any rate favourable 
            to political conformity. (Image of a series of brainwashed Inphos.)" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 20.jpg" 
            alt="GO: Speaking in vague euphemisms helps you avoid confrontation with the actual meaning of what 
            you're saying, which in politics, where the truth is often too offensive to face, is extremely useful." 
            class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 21.jpg" 
            alt="GO: For instance, consider some English professor defending Russian totalitarianism. 
            He can't say: (Cartoon of the same raggedy professor saying, 'I believe in killing off
            your opponents when you can get good results by doing so.')" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 22.jpg" 
            alt="GO: Probably, therefore, he will say something like this: (Same professor, 'While freely conceding that
            the Soviet regime exhibits certain features which the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we must, I think, 
            agree that a certain curtailment of the right to political opposition is an unavoidable 
            concomitant of transitional periods, and that the rigors which the Russian people have been called upon to undergo 
            have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement.')" class="panel">

            alt="(Back in the podcast studio.) Inpho: Um... pardon?
            GO: Exactly! You see, when you don't use short words, and you don't create pictures in 
            your listener's mind, what you get is meaningless drivel." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 24.jpg" 
            alt="This 'meaningless drivel', or what you might also call 'political language', is 
            'a language designed to make lies sound truthful, murder respectable, and to give an appearance
            of solidity to pure wind.' (Cartoon of the same old professor with #phd.)" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 25.jpg" 
            alt="(Back in the podcast studio.) Inpho: And it does all that just by avoiding words 
            that are too visual or concrete?
            GO: Yes! You see, 'our thoughts, in their pure state, do not exist as words at all...'"

            alt="(Cartoon of Inpho with a thought bubble of the world.) When you think of a concrete object, 
            you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to describe 
            the thing you have been visualizing, you hunt about until you find the exact words 
            that seem to fit." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/LanguageAndTotalitarianism/Language and Totalitarianism - 27.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of Inpho thinking of the images from the reading.) Probably it is better 
            to put off using words as long as possible and get one’s meaning as clear as one can 
            through pictures or sensations. Afterwards you can choose the phrases that 
            will best cover the meaning." class="panel">

            alt="(Back in the podcast studio.) Inpho: Well, thanks so much for being here, George!
            Though I wish you would have told me all this stuff about words before I decided to start a podcast.
            GO: Why? What do you mean?" class="panel">
