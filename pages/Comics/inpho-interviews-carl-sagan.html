            CS: Well, not quite. You see, Inpho, it turns out that the universe is really nothing more than
            a great mass of information, and it all gets mixed around and recycled in an infinite number 
            of ways." class="panel">

            alt="(The binary code reshapes itself to look like a smiley face.) CS: So although
            a version of me has died, in your imagination you can reassemble the information that contributed 
            to my existence and recreate a simulation of who I am." class="panel">

            alt="Inpho: Marijuana? But aren't you a scientist?

            CS: I am convinced that there are genuine and valid levels of perception available 
            with cannabis which are, through the defects of our society and our educational system,
            unavailable to us without such drugs." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Carl Sagan, Part 2/SaganonWeed13.jpg" 
            alt="(Close up on Carl Sagan looking stern.) CS: Crazy indeed! The illegality of cannabis
            is outrageous, and an imediment to the full utilization of a drug which helps to produce 
            serenity and insight so desparately needed in this increasingly mad and dangerous world."

            I have information overload?" class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Carl Sagan, Part 3/Sagan202.jpg" 
            alt="(Inpho and Carl Sagan in the podcast studio.) CS: Well, just think about the
            amount of information you're exposed to every day. Billions of people at a time 
            are broadcasting their thoughts to the whole world through a revolutionary new medium.
            It's enough to drive anyone crazy." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Carl Sagan, Part 3/Sagan203.jpg" 
            alt="(Close up on Carl Sagan.) CS: The good news is that nature has enountered this
            problem before; and over the course of the earth's evolution, it has developed numerous
            inventions that were designed to harness all that information." class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of the DNA double helix.) CS: One of the first inventions: DNA.
            Your DNA has all the information needed to create you. That's the equivalent 
            of a one thousand volume encyclopedia of information, and there's a complete copy
            of it stored in every single cell in your body." class="panel">

            alt="(Carl Sagan holding up an image of DNA.) CS: But, despite DNA's immense storage
            capacity, there came a time in our evolution when it simply wasn't enough. Something new
            had to be invented..." class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of a brain side by side with cartoons of neurons.) CS: The brain!
            Your brain processes information through a network of 100 billion neurons. That's close 
            to the number of stars in the milky way galaxy." class="panel">

            <img src="../../images/Carl Sagan, Part 3/Sagan209.jpg" 
            alt="(Cartoon of an open book in outer space.) CS: Books are magic. One
            glance at a book, and you hear the voice of another person--perhaps someone dead for 
            thousands of years. Across the millennia the author is speaking, clearly and silently 
            inside your head, directly to you." class="panel">
