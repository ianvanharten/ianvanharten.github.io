            Thoth: Over time, the meaning that humans assigned to these picture symbols began to change. 
            People wanted to use writing to represent ideas as well as objects. And so, towards that end, 
            writing evolved." class="panel">

            Plato: Most ingenious Thoth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or their 
            harmfulness belongs to another; and now you who are the father of [writing] have been led by your affections to ascribe
            to it a power the opposite of that which it really possesses. For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of 
            those who use it." class="panel">

            will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom,
            not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction, and will therefore seem to
