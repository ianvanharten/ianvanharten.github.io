            What you might not know is that before his legendary career in children's
            lit, Dr. Seuss worked for the United States Army! 
            He served during WWII in the Information and Education Division, 
            writing instructional cartoons and other movies made for U.S. soldiers." class="panel">

            Dr. Seuss wrote scripts for these movies (including cartoons) that 
            were designed to influence and educate young soldiers, many of 
            whom were 18 or 19 years old when they signed up." class="panel">

            the question: How did this WWII film producer, Theodore Geisel, go on to
            become one of the world's most beloved children's writers? 
            And joining us now to help out with this discussion, please welcome to the

            Dr. Seuss: Happy to be here, Inpho. And please, call me Ted." class="panel">

            alt="Inpho: Okay, Ted. So can you tell us about how you got started making 
            cartoons during the war?
            Dr. Seuss: Sure, well, I was a fairly well-known cartoonist at the time, 
            and the army was looking for cartoonists. So I signed up." class="panel">

            Inpho: Hold on. The army was looking for cartoonists?
            Dr. Seuss: They were. In fact, the Warner Brothers were there working 
            for them, too." class="panel">

            Tunes?
            Dr. Seuss: Yep. They animated and produced all the 
            cartoons I wrote for the army." class="panel">

            alt="Inpho: But why was the army interested in you guys in the first place? 
            Why cartoons?
            Dr. Seuss: Well, in preparing for the war, the army needed a way to mass 
            educate and train their men. Not only with how to use the equipment and
            such, but also with having the right attitudes and discipline for war... " class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of a kid being brainwashed by the TV.)
            Dr. Seuss: They believed that animated films were the best and most 
            effective tools of communication they could use to accomplish this." class="panel">

            Dr. Seuss: You see, recruits into the army at that time all had very 
            different levels ofeducation. A lot of them didn't even know how to read." class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of a teacher giving a boring lecture and all the students are asleep.)
            Dr. Seuss: They needed a way to educate and influence these soldiers in a
            way that could work across all educational levels, and that wouldn't also 
            bore them all to death." class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of a soldier investigating a comic book.)
            Dr. Seuss: In the 1920s and 1930s, comics were becoming very popular, 
            and the U.S. Government's Office of War Information was investigating 
            their potential use as a vehicle for propaganda." class="panel">

            Dr. Seuss: Their investigation eventually led them to create the 
            Information and Education Division stationed in Hollywood -- where I
            worked. My job was to help write and produce films for the army." class="panel">

            Inpho: And the movies you made were all cartoons?
            Dr. Seuss: Not all of them, but Private SNAFU, a cartoon series of about 
            30 short episodes, was one of our main projects. Through SNAFU we 
            taught soldiers about things like the importance of keeping military 
            secrets, and that you shouldn't get too distracted by beautiful women." class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of Dr. Seuss working on his SNAFU cartoons.)
            Dr. Seuss: Making those films was a massive education for me. I learned
            a lot about how to write, how to use rhythm and rhyme, and how to make 
            words and pictures work together to create stories." class="panel">

            alt="(Back in the studio.)
            Inpho: So... then you took everything you learned about writing 
            propaganda cartoons for the army and used it to write books for children?
            Dr. Seuss: Well... it's a bit more complicated than that." class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of Dr. Seuss at the microphone.)
            Dr. Seuss: The war affected us all very deeply. After it ended, I believed 
            very strongly that in order for something like this to never happen again, 
            'the next generation had to grow up to be more intelligent than ours.'" class="panel">

            alt="(Cartoon of a young Inpho reading childrens books.)
            Dr. Seuss: I also believed that a child's mind was the best place to go in 
            order to grow the imagination, and the vision, that could change the next 
            generation for the better. 
            In fact, I would even go so far as to say that..." class="panel">

            than any other form of literature on earth.'" class="panel">

            alt="Inpho: Wow. That is a profound statement. And, speaking of books, I was 
            hoping we could end by having you do a short reading from one of your books?
            Dr. Seuss: Why certainly!" class="panel">

            In the places I go there I things that I see
            That I never could spell 
            if I stopped with the Z.

            I’m telling you this cause you’re one of my friends.
            My alphabet starts 
            where your alphabet ends.

            My alphabet starts with this letter called YUZZ.
            It’s a letter I use to spell 
            YUZZ-a-ma-TUZZ.

            You’ll be sort of surprised what there is to be found
            Once you go beyond Z 
            and start poking around.

            So on beyond Zebra! It’s high time your were shown
            That you really don’t know 
            all there is to be known." class="panel">
